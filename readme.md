## Overview

This repository is designed for practitioners, researchers, and enthusiasts to explore, experiment, and implement key machine learning algorithms. It provides clear implementations of supervised and unsupervised models with comprehensive examples.

- **Supervised learning** algorithms are those where the model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs) and can be used for classification or regression tasks.
  
- **Unsupervised learning** algorithms work with unlabeled data and focus on finding underlying structures such as clusters or patterns in the data.

## Algorithms

### Supervised Learning
These algorithms are trained using labeled datasets. The model learns to map inputs to the correct outputs. Key algorithms in this category include:

- **Linear Regression** (for regression tasks)
- **Logistic Regression** (for binary classification)
- **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Naive Bayes**

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning algorithms work with data that does not have labeled outputs. These models focus on identifying hidden structures or groupings in the data. Algorithms include:

- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
- **Autoencoders** (for dimensionality reduction)
