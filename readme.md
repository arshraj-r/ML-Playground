# Machine Learning Algorithms: Supervised & Unsupervised

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Algorithms** repository! This project aims to provide a collection of implementations and examples for both **supervised** and **unsupervised** machine learning algorithms. Whether you're looking to classify data, make predictions, or uncover hidden patterns, this repository has a variety of models and techniques to explore.

## Overview

This repository is designed for practitioners, researchers, and enthusiasts to explore, experiment, and implement key machine learning algorithms. It provides clear implementations of supervised and unsupervised models with comprehensive examples.

- **Supervised learning** algorithms are those where the model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs) and can be used for classification or regression tasks.
  
- **Unsupervised learning** algorithms work with unlabeled data and focus on finding underlying structures such as clusters or patterns in the data.

## DataSets
I have created classes to import the data and split it into train-test. These classes are further used in my codes to import data.
The Sorces used for Data are:
# Popular Datasets for Regression

Here are some popular datasets for regression available from various sources:

1. **[Scikit-learn Datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/)**
   - Includes datasets like the **Boston Housing**, **Diabetes**, and **California Housing** datasets.

2. **[Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)**
   - Kaggle offers a variety of datasets for regression tasks, including **House Prices** and **Titanic**.

3. **[OpenML](https://www.openml.org)**
   - OpenML is a platform with numerous datasets for machine learning, including datasets for regression.

4. **[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)**
   - A long-established repository of datasets, including those for regression tasks such as **Wine Quality** and **Energy Efficiency**.

5. **[Statsmodels Datasets](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/datasets/index.html)**
   - Provides datasets for statistical modeling, including regression datasets.

6. **[Seaborn Datasets](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.load_dataset.html)**
   - Seaborn includes datasets for regression such as the **Tips** and **Diamonds** datasets.

### Supervised Learning
These algorithms are trained using labeled datasets. The model learns to map inputs to the correct outputs. Key algorithms in this category include:

- **Linear Regression** (for regression tasks)
- **Logistic Regression** (for binary classification)
- **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Naive Bayes**

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning algorithms work with data that does not have labeled outputs. These models focus on identifying hidden structures or groupings in the data. Algorithms include:

- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
- **Autoencoders** (for dimensionality reduction)
